# TODO - HTML Functionality

5. Once all 5 sections are completed:
    - hide instructions, question block, and "Submit" button

and display a results box with the following:
    
    - "Results" header
    - "Your color is:" text
    - "[USER'S COLOR]" in the corresponding color the user is.

At this point, don't worry about the database/viewing other results. Make sure that HTML is working as intended FIRST AND FOREMOST.

# DONE

1. Display ONLY test starter and hide it once "Begin Test" is pressed. - DONE

2. Make visible:
    - simplified instructions reminder at top of screen - REPLACED for back button on left - DONE
    - 4 horizontal question block templates - DONE
    - "Submit" button below the questions - DONE, moved to right
  
3. Make sure all four responses of each question block:
    - are saved for each distinct letter and display in console (at least for testing) when "Submit" is pressed - DONE
    - are unique / no repeats - DONE

    If the user tries to submit more than one of the same number, display a message stating this is not allowed. - DONE

4. Once above is completed, pressing "Submit" should update the four question blocks by using a JavaScript function to update the 4 letters and each group of words. - DONE, multiple question blocks in HTML
