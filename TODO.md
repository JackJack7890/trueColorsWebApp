# TODO - HTML Functionality

1. Display ONLY test starter and hide it once "Begin Test" is pressed.

2. Make visible:
    - simplified instructions reminder at top of screen
    - 4 horizontal question block templates
    - "Submit" button

3. Make sure all four responses of each question block:
    - are saved for each distinct letter and display in console (at least for testing) when "Submit" is pressed
    - are unique / no repeats

    If the user tries to submit more than one of the same number, display a message stating this is not allowed.

===
4. Once above is completed, pressing "Submit" should update the four question blocks by using a JavaScript function to update the 4 letters and each group of words.

===
5. Once all 5 sections are completed:
    - hide instructions, question block, and "Submit" button
    - display a results box with:
            - "Results" header
            - "Your color is:" text
            - "[USER'S COLOR]" in the corresponding color the user is.

    At this point, don't worry about the database/viewing other results. Make sure that HTML is working as intended FIRST AND FOREMOST.
